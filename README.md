# CWE-Security

CWEâ„¢ is a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types. It serves as a common language, a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.

This project provides an automated interface to access the latest CWEs. Teams are encouraged to map their vulnerabilities to CWEs to promote consistency.
